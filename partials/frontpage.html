            Computers are gradually replacing the manual parts of the electoral
            process. However, software systems are complex, prone to programming error, and
            are vulnerable to malicious attacks. If not addressed early, <em>these problems will
            have a negative effect on the very foundations of democracy</em>.

            DemTech provides answers on how to modernize the
            democratic process without jeopardizing the fundamental principles on which
            democracies are built.
            To do so, DemTech focuses on the voting technology
            as a whole, concentrating not only on technology and security, but also on
            questions related to organization, trust, and social choice.
