                <p>
                    Computers are gradually replacing the manual parts of the electoral
                    process. For instance, information technology is used in many countries
                    for registering voters, maintaining the electoral roll, casting votes, tallying
                    results and computing seat assignments to parties in parliament. Politicians
                    and administrators often advocate the use of technology with the aim to
                    make the electoral process more efficient, informative and economical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, software systems are complex, prone to programming error, and
                    are vulnerable to malicious attacks. If not addressed early, these problems will
                    have a negative effect on the very foundations of democracy.

                <p>
                    DemTech provides answers to the question of how to modernize the
                    democratic process without jeopardizing the fundamental principles on which
                    democracies are built. To do so, DemTech focuses on the voting technology
                    as a whole, concentrating not only on technology and security, but also on
                    questions related to organization, trust, and social choice. To ensure that
                    voters' trust that their votes have been cast and counted correctly, we also
                    focus on the social, political and cultural implications inherent in the digital
                    transformation of the democratic process.

                    DemTech aims to provide decision makers important and invaluable insights
                    into how voting technology can&#8212;or cannot&#8212;benefit the electoral process.
                    It is important to realize that we do not sell any technology or any technical
                    solution. In fact, all our results and findings are public so that anybody&#8212;the
                    government, the public, and also the industry&#8212;can benefit from our
                    research. In that way we hope to avoid conflict of interest and to increase our
                    trustworthiness.

                    Since the year 2000, all but eleven countries have held national elections,
                    and many of these countries used, or at least experimented with, information
                    technology to assist the electoral process. Some held binding internet
                    elections; others decided to continue to conduct elections the traditional way.
                    The experiences collected during these elections, in particular, advantages,
                    disadvantages, requirements, evaluations and risk analyses, are of interests to
                    the international community. DemTech strives to help design, evaluate, learn
                    from, and evolve these experiments and contribute with insights regarding the
                    difficult technological questions related to the secrecy, security, and integrity
                    of the election in the greater societal context. DemTech brings together
                    internationally leading experts on voting technology and elections. Our
                    international research staff collaborates, communicates, and consults with
